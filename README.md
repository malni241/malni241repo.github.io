## Idea
The idea is to do an image gallery to share all your pictures online. You can then rank all the pictures.


## Things we tried but didn't work
We did try a lot of stuff that unfortunatly did not work out for us. Here is a list and discriotion of what
did not work in the end:

- Unit test in Jest: 
They do work but you have to uncomment all the 'module.exports' calls. You can't run the page and have these calls in. If you comment them out everything works fine. The tests do pass when you run them it's just that it is not possible to have them there all the time. 

- Sorting by Ranking: 
Did not work and we don't know why. 

- VueFire:
We tried for a very long time, using differnt approches, to get this to work but in the end it did not. This means that right now we do not have live updates of the Firestore database. It works when you flip through the pages but not rerendering for the ranking system. 

- Dialog box
When pressing the rate-button in the dialog window it does not close. We have done everything that is said in the documentation of vuetify but it sill will not close when clicking the button.
